# Installing the toolbox:

### ...as a .mltbx toolbox:
First, download the ~100 MB .mltbx file [here](http://chadagreene.com/ClimateDataToolbox.mltbx). After downloading the .mltbx file, installation should be as easy as double clicking on the zip file and clicking "install". Or you can navigate to it in the Matlab file explorer, right click on the .mltbx, and click "Install." 

The installation process puts the files in a folder called 

```~MATLAB/Add-Ons/Toolboxes/Climate Data Toolbox/```

### ...or as individual files and folders:
The files in this GitHub repository may be slightly more up to date than the prepackaged .mltbx toolbox. So if you want to be on the bleeding edge of innovation, get the cdt folder, put it somewhere Matlab can find it, and then right-click on it from within Matlab and select "Add to Path--Selected folder and subfolders."

# After installation:
Type 

```cdt```

into the command line to check out the documentation.
